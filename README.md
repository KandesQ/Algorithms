# Algorithms and Data Structures
### There's three languages I use to solve Leetcode problems

 - Python : easy/medium
 - C : data structures
 - C++ : medium/hard

## Python
First off, python is used to solve easy/some medium problems, where I concentrate on a problem core, not the realisation details. That's why Python is the best tool for such question

## C
Another one is C, it has the lack of build-in tools, but when you write data structures from scratch - it's power is on top. So, it's my choise for writing and understanding concepts of modern data structure such as HashTable, LinkedList, ArrayList, etc (See the Java origins broou :&)

## C++
The last is C++. I assume it's functionallity and freedom of actions as Ð° Ultimate tool in the world of Milky Way. Language time limits - beats the most, build-in tools for any activity - either, code style and architecture - I love it so mush as Spring simplicity and friendliness. It'd be the end of my journey as a student of IT when i superb it. Let'z go chumbaz ;P
